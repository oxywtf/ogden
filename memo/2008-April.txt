How do I go about building, installing, using the svn code?  Or is it not in a 
usable state yet?

thanks,

I haven't focused on building yet, since it still has some major bugs
to shake loose. I've only had enough time recently to do a little work
on it --namely to get Orderable almost working. But I'll try to get
this in order in the next week, and give a status update then.
