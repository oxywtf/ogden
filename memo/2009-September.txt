Subject: [Ogden] status update, ruby 1.9
Message-ID: <1254165923.3726.1.camel@jjg-linux>

Hello,

I haven't seen any activity on Og/Ogden for quite a while and was
wondering if anyone had been able to get it running with ruby 1.9?  I
assume it would involve quite a few changes and moving to a newer facets
library.

Thanks,
Jesse
