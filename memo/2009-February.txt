Hi,

sorry for not getting back to you sooner, but real life got in the
way...I've tried reproducing your results, but I don't seem to get the
same errors...I still get errors though  ;) 

This is my results so far:
1) Cloned the git repository

2) Tried to find out which version of Facets that worked...I tried every
version from 1.4.5 (the version that Og uses) to 2.5.0. The *only* ones
that worked for me was 2.4.1, 2.4.2 and 2.4.3...so I settled for 2.4.3.

3) Modified the demo.rb file to include the the new lib
$LOAD_PATH << File.expand_path('../lib')

4) Changed a 'prop' call to a 'property' call on line 57 in run.rb

5) Ran it with 'ruby -rubygems run.rb' with the following results:

In other words, I broke the code in a completely different way...Any
ideas on how to proceed?

I have included patches I needed to make per Trans's comments.

There were two changes from he git master ...


   - Annotations is replaced by anise (ann_attrib.rb)
      - ## require "facets/annotations"  #wm:01
      - require "anise"               #wm:01

      - class Module
        include Anise   # <--- need this  #wm:02

      - Facets in (lib/og/main.rb)
      - ## require "facets/style"        #wm:01
         require "english"             #wm:01

      - ## require "facets/annotations"  #wm:01
         require "anise"               #wm:01

This is where we get separate results.  I'm using facets 2.5.0 .. there
appear to have been many structural changes.

Trans, can you alidate these two changes I used and set us on the right
path?

I would prefer if you push to git.  Because I'm not sure if these mods were
a work-around or the correct action.

Lars, I missed the step that needs a change to load--path.  That could be
me, I'm using netbeans and I just add a lib search path -I ... switch

   - 3) Modified the demo.rb file to include the the new lib
   $LOAD_PATH << File.expand_path('../lib')

I'm sorry now that I didn't send this to the list.  I wanted to keep the
chat down, since it looked like I was breaking something.

:-)   At least is is below 30?C now, and it is sane to 'work' when life lets
me.

Take care,

   Will

Hi again.

Your suggestions worked fine.  I'm attaching the two changed files.

   - main.rb
   - ann_attr.rb

Now I am befuddled -- I have what looks like perfectly "ok" ruby code and it
appears to NOT work.  What about this simple table structure ...

require 'og'

           ##==    Tables    ==##

class  User
  attr_accessor   :login,             String
  property        :password,          String
  property        :first_name,        String
  property        :last_name,         String

  many_to_many :projects

  has_many     :tickets
  has_many     :created_tickets,   Ticket
  has_many     :comments

end   #User        ________


But my friend ruby says that

   - "... 'property': String is not a symbol (TypeError)"
   - "... `attr_accessor': String is not a symbol (TypeError)


Despite some perfectly "good" ok code that once worked and ann_attr.rb has
the alias:

  alias_method :property, :attr_accessor

I can't seem to figure out where attr_accessor is declared.

Anyway the ogden/demo/run.rb fails with the same problem.

I can run diff on the og gem and ogden if you can give me a couple of ideas
where to look for attr_accessor's declaration.

It is used in too many places to find it easily ;-)

Thanks in advance,

                             w.

Those look right. There may be some work to do to mesh English with
what Og is used to, though it should entail only some minor
adjustments.

I'll try it myself here in a bit.

This is odd because

  DEBUG: CREATE TABLE `ogcomment` (`oid` integer(11) unsigned
AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, `author_oid` integer, `body` text)

So it says it is creating the field, but it doesn;t actually do it.
How is that possbile?

What I had to do:

I made one modification to Anise that will help with Ogden. I'll
release that soon.

'include Anise' at the top level. Not in Module. I did this in main.rb
and utils/ann_attr.rb. Eg:

  require "anise"
  include Anise

Eventually this should only be include in enchanted classes, but we'll
get to that later.

I had to add to main.rb:

  class String
    # Removes the module part from a modularized expression.
    def demodulize
      to_s.gsub(/^.*::/, '')
    end
  end

b/c English doesn't have this method.

Then wherever #style is used in the code replace with the proper
method. Eg.

  klass.to_s.style(:demodulize)  => klass.to_s.demodulize

Hi,

I'm feeling a bit confused about what git repository we?re talking about here. So, can you please answer the following questions?

a) Are you talking about the Git repository on Rubyforge(git://rubyforge.org/ogden.git)? Or is there another repository that is used for development?

b) Which version of Facets are you aiming to use with Ogden? Facets seems to be very volatile, perhaps it's appropriate to specify a version (or versions) of Facets that is supposed to work with Ogden?

Yes. That repository. If you would like me to setup a GitHub mirror, I
can do that too.

I am using the latest version 2.5.1, actually 2.5.2 which will be
released soon. It's not a volatile as it might seem. Ogden has been
dormant so it hasn't been updated since before 2.4.0, except for a
little bit of the work that I've done. 2.4 was a BIG release for
Facets and saw a few libraries move to separate projects, eg. Anise
and English --the originals of which have been deprecated as of 2.5.

As soon as I can get commit privs back, I will do everything that is
needed to get Og working with the latest Facets. No problem there.

Chris Scheper, can you add me as either a Senior Developer or an Admin
to the rubyforge project. Thanks!

Did it commit?

A friend had a problem something like that.  We discovered a typo in the
SQL.

Since you are doing an INSERT to the dbms, it should be logged in admin.

Depending on the database you are using.

Either that, or an exception is being swallowed at low level.

Just thoughts I'm afraid.

Hi groovers !!

Trans, I agree with Lars here -- we need to set development against a {known
profile} ... Not just Facets, other dependent modules as well.

This can be a very relaxed thing to do.  For example even with this wee
test.  I'm use a local copy of the og-0.41.0, and any other overrides, with
an Include switch, like this ::

  *  -Iw:\sandbox\og-0.41.0\lib;
  *    w:\sandbox\lib\ruby;

Which overrides the gem path, etc.

I use the path for other things (like ... w:\sandbox\lib\python and so and
such).

That idea may not work where people are working with different modules and
versions.

Is there a simple way to "choose" specific versions of gem units?  I think
it may be a (*)project itself, if it doesn't exist.  (I completely admit to
gem internals ignorance).

Here's a thought -- Let me know if we have that.

   -- In top-level modules, I can do something like
       ... require config.rb

It will automgaically pick up the local or include path config file.

... It might have to happen in the GEM-s module to only require the versions
of modules in the config file

What do ya think?.

I am merely functional with Ruby (and good with  DRY), in another life I'm
an excellent with release management and configuration management. ;-)

ok. I just pushed the changes that get us to the missing column
(article_oid) when running the demo.

I am going to spend some time cleaning up the code related to the
dependencies some more.

BTW anyone know about this note in lib/og/inflect.rb

# NOTE: This is "vendor" material from English project.

Who said it was being rebranded?

I think it's a good idea. I will work that into my changes. Mainly
it's a matter of using the gem command with a version parameter.

As for 0.41, anyone who wants to can go back and do the same, but I'm
hoping we can just push forward and get a new release out the works as
good or better than 0.41 soon. Now that some interest has picked up.

Subject: [Ogden] ogcomment issue
Message-ID: <6edc4a9c-46c5-4105-ab00-9fda40fc7464@r36g2000prf.googlegroups.com>

I think I've narrowed down the problem with the demo. This is some of
the debug output:

  DEBUG: CREATE TABLE ogcomment (body text, oid integer PRIMARY KEY)
  INFO: Created table ogcomment.
  DEBUG: SELECT * FROM ogcomment LIMIT 1
  DEBUG: CREATE TABLE ogcomment (oid integer PRIMARY KEY, author_oid
integer, body text)
  DEBUG: SELECT * FROM ogcomment LIMIT 1
  DEBUG: CREATE TABLE ogcomment (oid integer PRIMARY KEY, article_oid
integer, body text)
  DEBUG: SELECT * FROM ogcomment LIMIT 1

As you can see, it tries to create the same table three times. I
suspect what it happening is the first time works as indicated by the
INFO, and the others silently fail. In the code, the issue appears a
little more complicated. We have:

  class Comment
    attr_accessor :body, String

  class ArticleComment < Comment
    belongs_to Article

  class UserComment < Comment
    belongs_to :author, User

  class Article
    has_many :comments, ArticleComment

  class User
    has_many :comments, UserComment

So I think that the three comment tables are being created by Comment,
ArticleComment and UserComment, but they are clearly not getting the
right table names. So that's the major clue. We just need to find
where the table names are being generated and fix.

Also, technically Comment need not have a table at all since it is
just being used as a base class. I'm not sure how easy that will be to
fix though.

+1 default and you can turn it off

Hi all

I feel that the 'og' is a bit of labelling without purpose.  Wouldn't the
'ideal thing' be to not know what a object is unless you need to or you are
debugging?

If it was my selection, I'd make it a suffix (because it is incidental
information, as far as I can tell) and the default might be off.  Although
as a suffix, I think it is ok if it is ON by default.

I can it be a SQL like name, either way:  'OG_tablename' (prefix) or
'tablename_OG' (suffix)

:-)

If a class is a base class (or an abstract) class -- Then it definitely
should NOT be created in a table.

I am not definite if a tool like og knows that (or can know it??)  It would
be cool if it can work that out.

At the same time, we might use the OO language to label base classes like
that as 'Abstract' anyway as an optional attribute.

I took another look at the demo ... My understanding here is that the
Comment class is the table implementation of all comments and it is NOT a an
abstract class, it is what I might call an "Implementation Vehicle" class

Both   are only use to establish the 'Belongs to' relationships.

In light of that interpretation, we could think of  ArticleComment and
UserComment as "linkage only".

I would say for now, we leave the conceptual areas "as is" until the code is
working in a functional way.

:-)

I think the reason behind that was that some dbs have reserved table
names for their own use, prefixing with og would allow you to use any
name.
The prefix is optional anyway, as far as i can remember.
Just checked the source and it tells me that one can do:
Og.table_prefix = nil
to turn it off, or assign a string to set your own prefix.

Hi!

Well, before we can start to investigate what tables need to be created, wouldn't it be nice to have a definition of what each "relating" method is supposed to do? My relational db modeling skills isn't to good, but I believe it works kind of like below:

Assuming that A is the current table, B is a related table and C is a join table needed by a relation between A and B

A.property creates a field in A
A.has_one creates a field in A. The field is pointing to a unique key (row) in B
A.has_many creates a field in B. The field is pointing to a unique key (row) in A
A.many_to_many creates two fields in C, each pointing to a unique key (row) in A and B
A.belongs_to creates a field in A. The field is pointing to a unique key (row) in B

Please feel free to correct me/nake clarifications!

Hi all :-)

Hope your well ... I'll repeat for reinforcement, that I'd like to see the
code base stable and working "as intended" :-)  The implications for
property and fields, are specifics to the og ruby library -- In their
implemetation of the Object graph model (see link below) over an under-lying
relational (or other ) implementation.

As to the the entity relationship modelling, we should start with the
relational algebras from ::

   - Entity relationship model ....
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_relationship
   - Data modelling ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_modeling

However, I need to stress that object graphs don't do "relational algebra"
they may _map_ on object onto a relational algebra model like a Relational
Database.  A little history is in order now.

In the 'old days' the best data base performance was from 'clean' Networked
Databases. All messy databases of all architectures created problems.  The
OG method creates a newtorked

   - Object Graph .....................
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_graph
   - Network Database model ....
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_database

Network models are pretty cool, as long as you CAN take care of the
'relational rules' and implications.

The specific case of the Comments table; my interpretation of the observed
behaviour is that I like the implication.  That ... seems to show that
Relationship-only subclasses of Comments are able to be housed in the
OG_Comments table.  (That's just my reading of the information/guess).

Mind you ... I admit that it's a pretty sweet idea, but I think there's a
flaw.  You also need a column to indicate the Actual Class any particular
Row represents in the table.  (I worked for 9 years on a product that used
to do just that).

I reckon stable code that does the Expected is a better step forward.  What
I mean here by expected is ...

||
||    class ArticleComment < Comment
||          belongs_to Article
||
||     class UserComment < Comment
||          belongs_to :author, User
||

Two tables (not one)

*    OG_USERCOMMENT
*    OG_ARTICLECOMMENT

Not one, an OG_COMMENT.  Following my conversation so far, I'd see a shared
OG_COMMENT table as an optimisation, not necessarily a default behaviour.
That is a late discussion, imho.

Regards,
               Will


P.S.

If you refer to C.J.Date's book, "What, not How?!" he points out that
relational algebra was the key factor in the resilience of relational
database model implementations.  Efficeient models would use the best
solution under-the-hood to implement a BUSINESS MODEL :-)

Which sometimes I consider it is worth reminding people the reason to do
this stuff is to build efficient operational models for a use case,
enterprice, game, etc.  That's why I like OG, it goes a long way to dealing
with the appropriate end-user-case.  :-)

Very good point. And I think something to consider for the future,
once what we have is working satisfactorily.

Hi All,

Just want to let you know that I've gotten as far as I can with the
code without going into the next level of understanding the code.

Unfortunately I have some other more pressing things to do right now,
so I hoping some of you will take up the next phase of ringing out the
test suite bugs.

BTW, to run the tests:

  ogden$ spec test/suite.rb

Let me know.

Thanks,
T.

Subject: [Ogden] have you looked at roog?
Message-ID: <9e03c3c60902270559j6775a99asac6ed66777a45a3@mail.gmail.com>

Hello folks ...

Does anyone know much about the pippin and roog framework for XML object
graphs?

   *  http://pippin.rubyforge.org/

It looks interesting, and may be of future bearing for OG.

Myself, I'm interested in taxonomies.  I don't think real people(tm) use
"ontologies" ... A Duck is a duck, until you want to find "another thing
that quacks".  An ontology can't do that (by definition) ... Nor as I
understand it might a multiple inheritance framework.

Two taxonomies, CAN give me "duck calls" when I ask for "things that quack".


I'm interested in sensemaking, and I think lateral thinking can be a path to
providing support for quacks!  Any comment is welcome.

aloha,
        \_w_/
